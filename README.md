# Parallel-Radix-Multithread-Sorting
(CECS 325: System Programming)
•	Implemented parallelized radix sort algorithm in C++, sorting millions of numbers in seconds. Utilized multithreading for efficient sorting of large datasets.
•	Utilized counting sort within radix sort for digit-wise sorting. Achieved enhanced performance through concurrent sorting of eight segments. Proficiently managed thread synchronization and merging of sorted segments.
